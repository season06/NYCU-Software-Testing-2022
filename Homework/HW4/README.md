# Homework 4: Mutation Based Testing

Download and install the Java mutation tool: [muJava](https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/mujava/). Use muJava to test [cal()](https://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/softwaretest/java/Cal.java). Use all the operators. Design tests to kill all non-equivalent mutants. Note that a test case is a method call to cal().

(a) How many mutants are there?

(b) How many test cases do you need to kill the non-equivalent mutants?

(c) What mutation score were you able to achieve before analyzing for equivalent mutants?

(d) How many equivalent mutants are there?
